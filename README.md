# Coding Challenges Repository

Welcome to my **Coding Challenges** repo! This is where I keep track of all the programming challenges Iâ€™m tackling as I learn new languages and improve my problem-solving skills.

## ðŸ“‚ Current Focus

Right now, Iâ€™m focusing on **C++** and working through **50 different challenges** to master the fundamentals and patterns. As I progress, I will be adding folders for other programming languages and challenges.

### Languages Covered (so far):
- **C++**: 50+ programs
- **Python** (coming soon)
- **JavaScript** (coming soon)
- ... and more!

## ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Find Here
- **Organized challenge folders** for each language I work on.
- Solutions to various coding problems: from loops and patterns to algorithms.
- A journey of continuous learning and growth in software development.

## ðŸš€ My Goal
This repo is an ongoing project that reflects my learning process. Each challenge I complete represents a step toward becoming a better programmer. Feel free to explore, contribute, or leave feedback!

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
